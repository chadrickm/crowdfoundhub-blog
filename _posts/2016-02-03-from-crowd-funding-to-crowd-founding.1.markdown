As many of us in the (Libertarian) cryptocurrency space are well aware, governments are often late to the game, and once they finally do catch up, they oftentimes hinder more than help when it comes to supporting disruptive technology. Change is a scary thing to the control brokers. They base a lot of their decisions on the gain or loss of control the disruptive technology will bring. Either the control they themselves have or those that lobby them to act one way or another. Both groups fear losing the leverage they currently have.

Crowdfunding was an entrepreneurial endeavor to meet a need that people wanted. Kickstarter is probably the most widely known company in the space, but there are many others. It wasn't long before people were clambering for more than a free copy of a new product or application. Micro-stake in the new startups was on a lot of people's minds. The average person might now, on a much smaller scale than that of the wealthy investors, be able to invest in the creation of something new, and might receive some real reward if things worked out for the fledgling startup.

As oftentimes happens, the government, in the name of protecting people from themselves, decided people couldn't own any stake in the endeavors they were helping to fund. That privilege was saved for the accredited investor, at least in the US. People might be snookered into losing all they owned by some well spoken con-man. To be sure, only a few out of the many investments will be winners, there will be con-artists and caution should always be taken. It's to bad we couldn't have held the authorities to those same rules and regulations when it came to their own banking industry debacles. Perhaps they were correct in worrying about the masses, seeing we always seem to fall for their slick promises. But I'm getting off topic a bit.

While investors, flush with capital, waited and lobbyists lobbied, the cryptocurrency community did what they do best. Just as with the finance industry before, rather than ask for permission, they built the solutions that people were excited about, on the same unregulated technological framework that made bitcoin possible.

They held crowdsales in crypto to fund many new endeavors. People responded en masse and in their realm at least, ground was broken and much progress continues to be made in the “fund for ownership” space.

In the “ask permission” regulated realm of the US, the JOBs act was signed, and slowly, though a couple years later, the rules are finally available for us who want to be good law-abiding citizens, to follow. The nagging fear in this cynic’s mind at least, is that there are so many laws and regulations that we are probably guilty or will be guilty somewhere along the line. I hope to eventually write a post about where things stand in the US, but I'm more excited about the cutting edge, unregulated cryptocurrency solutions out in the wild right now.

## Models of Crowdfounding

I know of at least two models of crowdfounding in cryptocurrency today but I'm sure there are more. Each has its potential advantages and disadvantages. I'll try to summarize the best I can, though I'm not an expert in any of them. If I do write something inaccurately please contact me and I'll do my best to make it right.

### Crowdsale for Future Assets

The first and I believe, most widely used is what I'll call the “crowdsale for future assets” model. In the majority of these sales, the investor is sending bitcoins or other alt-coins to an address and eventually receives promissory coins, or tokens at the address from which the investment originated. The temporary tokens are limited in number and usually they are a small portion of the maximum number of tokens that will ever exist. These temporary coins can and are traded as speculators watch the progress of the endeavor they funded. The team who is working on the endeavor, takes the bitcoins and uses the finances to build the project. Eventually when the project is completed, the temporary tokens are converted for real coins that the project uses.

#### Examples

* [***Maidsafe***](http://maidsafe.net) - MaidSafe replaces today's existing server centric and intrusive systems with a fully distributed, safe, secure and private network. A network with no third party being able to intercept, copy, steal, sell or otherwise access the network’s data.
* [***Ethereum***](https://ethereum.org) - Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

#### Advantages

* Simplicity for the sellers is probably the greatest advantage for this type of crowdsale. The sellers are free to do what they feel they need to do with the funds.
* Opt-In/Out for the Investors: As the project is being built, speculators are able to sell their temporary tokens if they believe the project is failing and they are able to buy more if they believe the project is succeeding. *This advantage is something crowdfunding providers should try to incorporate in their systems. Adam B. Levine, the founder and CEO of [Tokenly](https://tokenly.com), speaks about how it could be implemented in this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/o5gA63UiV-o) [4:30].*

#### Disadvantages

* There is little more than a “stain on their good name" to stop the sellers from “leaving town” with the funds. Because of the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency, legal action is probably impossible. As an investor you have to make up your own mind about the risks involved.
* Being forced to rely on immature technologies is another risk investors are taking when they are involved with anything cutting edge. The process of converting temporary tokens to real assets might go horribly wrong. The facts are we don't know all the facts. Each of us has to make up our own mind about these risks (there is a theme here in case you missed it).

### Crowdsale for DAC/DAO “Ownership”

DACs/DAOs or Distributed Autonomous Companies/Organizations are the latest dream of the cryptocurrency technology enthusiasts, and I'm going to devote multiple posts discussing them.
