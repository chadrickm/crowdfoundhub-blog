The definitions [vary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/), sometimes widely, on what Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) or Corporations, Companies or, my favorite term, Co-Ops (DACs) really are. It is safe to say that if you're using cryptocurrency technology as a way of IPOing your centralized startup and calling it a DAC, you're *probably* using the wrong term. I'll let others who know a ton more than I do, carry on the much needed debate about definitions, while I'll attempt to explain why DACs should, if you're anything like me, get us excited.

## Not the Time

Four hundred years ago was not the time to be an entrepreneur. Unless of course we were of the elite class, had connections with royalty, and happened to be quite wealthy already. Had the regent of the time deemed you favorably, you might have been granted a royal charter to carry on your dealings. The chances that a commoner would have been allowed to prosper is pretty minuscule.

A couple hundred years later things looked a bit better. With governments getting more and more out of the business of business and the idea of deregulation becoming popular, the private sector was starting to see some growth. On the rise too was scheming con artists who were lining their pockets with other people’s money, rather than creating real value for their society.

Along with those leeches were the monopoly creators. Protectionism has always been a high priority for those with the leverage. Don't let anyone threaten your golden goose, even if the next goose lays diamond eggs; especially if the next goose lays diamond eggs. Monopolies were created and crushed, and created again. The protectionist war over disruptive technologies never ceases and inevitably the technology that is allowed to come to the public’s attention soon puts inflexible industries out of business almost overnight.

## Fast Forward to Today...

...and we find ourselves in something of a paradigm shifting time in history. The world at large doesn't seem to recognize where we are yet. The “old” paradigms of national boundaries and regulatory bodies blind many to the new possibilities. I'm sure I don't fully grasp the true potential that is available today, but risk taking investors are clambering for a piece of that not too distant future. And the cool thing about where we are today is, we don't have to be in the elite class or already wealthy in order to participate.

## What Are We Talking About

A corporation is:
> a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. Corporations enjoy most of the rights and responsibilities that an individual possesses; that is, a corporation has the right to enter into contracts, loan and borrow money, sue and be sued, hire employees, own assets and pay taxes.

A co-op is:
> an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and controlled enterprise.

These structures have internal laws (i.e. contracts) that it's members must abide by in order to stay positively associated with the organization. These organizations usually have a board of directors that direct the organization. If someone veers off course from the organizations intended direction it's the job of management and the board to set things right again. If they fail at their job or mask their real intended direction, people's lives are effected in a negative way. I'm purposely oversimplifying things here, but you get my meaning I hope.

The dream of the Distributed Autonomous Organization purists want to do away with human management. Computers are very good at solving logic problems and at the core that is what contracts are. Today humans solve logic problems, but we have these dangerous embedded viruses inside us called “motives”. Laws are written to make sure our actions fall in line with the desired outcomes of the ones making the laws rather than according to each person's individual whims.

*The contracts within a DAC are supposed to facilitate a mutual consent agreements between all actors within the DAC, as well as actors who interact with the DAC from the outside. There will be no surprises because the contracts are designed to be unchangeable, always running and free from any kind of censorship. **We can voluntarily work with any other voluntary member of the DAC with a high degree of certainty that each of us plans on following the rules that are defined within the contracts of the DAC, and if one of us doesn't, the programmed consequence will always result.***

## The Near Future

*We are almost at a point where **an economically, geographically and culturally diverse community of technical or nontechnical people can build (i.e. fund, direct, and fairly profit from) whatever it can dream of.*** That fact should cause us to sit up and take notice. I don't think I'm being overly dramatic when I use the phrase “paradigm shifting”. I’m not saying this will be some utopia. I am saying [this may allow us the freedom to come up with solutions](https://mises.org/library/market-doesnt-solve-problems-people-do) to the problems of our days. Making this happen will take a lot of hard work. Attempts may fail, but each failure will bring us to the next step, and eventually we will have success. We will continue to build on those successes. It's already well on its way, but a quote I read recently helps with perspective:

> There is this thing between the past and future called the present. ~ [InaneMembrane](https://www.reddit.com/user/InaneMembrane)

Figuring out exactly how to build distributed autonomous co-ops like this will require a lot of valuable resources. People with the time, energy, and know-how. Money to hire those people, because let's face it, people with know-how are often expensive to hire and finances are a reality of life. *And perhaps most importantly, **an autonomous structure that we mutually consent to, that is sovereign over each of our actions within the co-op** is a must.* Without a system of fair organization, resources are wasted, misused and we amble around with a vague understanding of the direction we want or feel we need to go. 

## A Call to Action

Every person reading this has resources to share. We might have time to dream it and promote it or money to fund it. We might have the expertise that is required to bring it to reality. Individually we are certainly lacking *all* that is needed, but ***together we have a chance to bring it about***.

That is “what” it is. In the [next post](http://crowd-founding.ghost.io/why-we-you-and-i-need-our-own-dac/) I’ll try to show one way it might be done with the technology we already have.
